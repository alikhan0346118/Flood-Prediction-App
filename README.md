- **Precision**: Accuracy of positive predictions
- **Recall**: Ability to find all positive cases
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## üìà Model Performance

The models are evaluated using:
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Stratified Sampling**: Maintains class distribution
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures robust performance estimates
- **Multiple Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation approach

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Models
To add a new machine learning model:

1. Import the model in the `train_models()` function
2. Add it to the `models` dictionary
3. Update the prediction interface to handle the new model

### Modifying Features
To use different features:

1. Update the `feature_columns` list in `prepare_features()`
2. Modify the input form in `show_prediction_interface()`
3. Update feature importance visualizations

### Styling Changes
The app uses custom CSS for styling. Modify the CSS section in the main function to change:
- Colors and themes
- Layout and spacing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimers

### Educational Purpose
This application is designed for educational and research purposes. It should not be used as the sole basis for emergency decisions.

### Data Limitations
- Uses synthetic data for demonstration
- May not reflect real-world conditions accurately
- Performance may vary in different geographic regions

### Professional Use
For actual flood risk assessment:
- Consult local meteorological authorities
- Use multiple data sources
- Follow official evacuation orders
- Consider local environmental factors

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Streamlit Not Starting**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501
   ```

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Close other applications
   - Reduce dataset size for testing
   - Use smaller model parameters

4. **Display Issues**
   - Check browser compatibility
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try different browsers

### Performance Optimization

- Use `@st.cache_data` for data loading
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
- Optimize model parameters for faster training
