- **5 features**: Rainfall, Elevation, Distance to River, Land Cover, Population Density
- **Binary target**: Flooded (0/1)

## ðŸ¤– Model Performance

Based on testing, the models achieve:
- **Random Forest**: 99.5% accuracy, 100% AUC
- **XGBoost**: 100% accuracy, 100% AUC  
- **Logistic Regression**: 84% accuracy, 89% AUC

## ðŸŽ® How to Use

1. **Data Overview** - Explore the dataset and visualizations
2. **Model Training** - Click "Train Models" to train all algorithms
3. **Model Comparison** - Compare performance across different metrics
4. **Predict Flood Risk** - Input environmental data for predictions
5. **About** - Learn more about the application

## âš¡ Quick Test

Run this to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_app.py
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**If the app doesn't start:**
- Check if all dependencies are installed: `pip list`
